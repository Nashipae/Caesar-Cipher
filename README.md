# Caesar Cipher App

#### Caesar Cipher is an app that encrypts and decrypts texts.

#### By *Naomi Wariara*

## Description

Caesar Cipher. A user inputs their text and the app encrypts the text by  rotating the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".  

## Specs
| Behavior        | Input           | Outcome  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| User is requested for text | User inputs text | App receives the text for encryption | Die rolls and number is generated |
| Text is logged in the console and is stored ready for encryption| Text from user is stored awaiting the shift value| Stored text |
| User is requested for shift value | User inputs shift value | The stored text is now encrypted by moving the text characters based on the value of the shift. |
| Encrypted text is decrypted back to the original text that user gave | System performs the decryption function which moves the encryoted text back to how it was before encryption based on the shift value that the user had given.| Decrypted text is shown in the console which appears similar to the origin text that user had keyed in.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. To access the app use a text Editor that can read Java files.
